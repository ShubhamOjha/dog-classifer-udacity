# Project: Dog Identification App 

## Overview :

This is a CNN based dog breed classifier project where we tried to load a pretrained model and train that model for a number of labeled dog breeds.
We attained an accuracy of 80.3828% and you can access the user interface for the same here [dog-classiffier.ml](dog-classiffier.ml)

Fun Fact: You can upload your pic and the model will try to predict most resembling dog breed.

## Dataset:

* You can download dog breed dataset from [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).
* You can download human dataset from [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).
* You can download bottleneck features from [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz) and should place it inside `bottleneck_features`
